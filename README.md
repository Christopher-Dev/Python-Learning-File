- for adding code "!eval print ('hello world!')"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Always Define your Variable.

Alwasy go in that order. if > elif > else

Always end an "if" "else" statement with a ":"

Use "#" to be able to add notes to explain code in script.

Always check syntex for functions, end functions with ":"

Always use a "[]" bracket when it comes to lists.

if you need to find the range of a number use a "print(list(range(x, y)))" function to have it print out in the terminal.

+ to take effect it muct be after the =
if you are adding to an existing variable, it has to be before
+= -> add to the value
=+ -> just an asignation to a positive number, no different than = + or =
